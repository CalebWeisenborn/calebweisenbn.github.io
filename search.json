    "text": "The 2023 College Football National Championship was an absolute blood bath. The TCU Horned Frogs came into the game 13-1, fresh off of a back and forth battle with the Michigan Wolverines. On the other side, the Georgia Bulldogs squeezed out a win vs the Ohio State Buckeyes on a last second missed field goal. Fans around the country settled in for the big game. Most had it turned off by halftime.\nTCU punched first, then it was all Georgia from there. Georgia went on to score 65 straight unanswered points. The Georgia defense made Heisman candidate Max Duggan’s life a living hell as he continuously found himself on his back. It was embarrassing, and many fans wondered why TCU was there. Was Georgia that good, or was TCU overrated?"
